                        The crown and stars are set in a rectangle taking up 80% of the white
                        stripe's height. The crown represents the Samanid dynasty and Tajik people, as 
                        the name Tajik is connected with Persian tâj "crown" in popular etymology.[12]
                        The flag of Tajikistan features seven stars due to the significance of the
                        number seven in Tajik traditional legends,the heavens feature seven mountains and seven
                        orchard gardens with Other interpretations of the colours state that
                        the flag symbolically unifies the people of Tajik society, a star shining above 
                        each mountain.

                 The flag of Tajikistan is a tricolour of red, white, and green. The red represents 
                 the unity of the nation as well as victory and sunrise. The red also serves as 
                 symbolism of the former Russian and Soviet eras,[5] the workers,[6] and the warriors 
                 who sacrificed their lives to protect the land.[7] The white represents purity,
                 morality, the snow and ice of the mountains, and cotton.[1][8][9][10] The green
                 represents the bountiful generosity of nature, fertile valleys, the religion of Islam,
                 and the celebration of Novruz.[10] Other interpretations of the colours state that
                 the flag symbolically unifies the people of Tajik society, with the red stripe
                 representing the manual labour class, the white stripe representing the intellectual
                 worker class, and the green representing the agricultural class living in Tajikistan's
                 rural or mountainous regions.
